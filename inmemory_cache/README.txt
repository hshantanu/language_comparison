create a map having int as key and string as value
create a method named Request which will return the value of a key

The method request works as follows
	if the key is present in the map return value
	if the key is not present and the size of map is less than 1000, append the key value pair at the end of map
	if the key is not present and the size of array is greater tha 1000 then replace the 1st element of the map.


key is in the range of 0 to 3000
value is same for all the keys and is "Testing val"
